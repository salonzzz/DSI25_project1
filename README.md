Problem Statement

Since 2001, states have been adopting and implementing varying state-wide assessments, including the ACT and SAT. Signing a contract with ACT inc. to administer the ACT had and continues to have two benefits in that it (i) provides students with an opportunity to take a college admissions test and (ii) encourages more students to consider college upon high school graduation. However, recently the SAT has been gaining more traction with the potential to outpace the ACT in participation. In this project, we aim to analyse ACT and SAT participation and scoring by state from 2017 and 2018 to better understand how we can improve ACT participation rates across states and whether increased participation in either test, does indeed show an uptick in high school graduates opting to go to college.

Conclusions and Recommendations

ACT inc. needs to focus on two objectives:
Persuade state boards, educators and students to endorse the efficacy of the ACT in preparing students for getting into college.
Persuade more state boards to draw contracts with the organisation.
Number 1: In 2016, the College Board revitalised the SAT and since then has not only secured more contracts with state-boards but has seen an uptick in participation rates. Additionally, participation in the SAT is seen to be positively associated with college going behaviour. This suggests that people are starting to prefer the SAT as it perhaps, better prepares students for college. Additionally, in states where college admission tests are not mandated, the SAT is still a cheaper alternative, making is more accessible to those from a financially challenged background. It also has the effect of incentivising more students to choose the SAT over the ACT.
It might be worth considering revising the content of the ACT to align it better with standards expected of students at college. Giving educators and students more confidence in the content and its ability to prepare them for college might improve participation rates and college going rates. An additional consideration may be to reduce the cost of the ACT to make it more accessible and appealing to students from varying socio-economic backgrounds.
The ACT needs to reiterate its purpose to students and educators- It exists to provide students with opportunity and access to better tertiary outcomes. This can be reinforced by reminding the public of the usefulness of the Science component in the ACT which gives students a competitive edge over their SAT counterparts. The ACT nurtures a more holistic and well-rounded student. Additionally, it needs to be communicated that evidence suggests that ACT scores are considered and awarded scholarships to universities more easily than SAT scores.
More test prep resources can be made available and accessible to students to boost their confidence in doing well in the test. For example, the college board collaborated with Khan Academy to release free test prep material to students. A similar tactic should be considered.
Despite the states requiring its students to take the ACT, Idaho and Utah see <50% of their students going to college. It suggests that they could use more test prep resources and encouragement to engage in college going behaviour.
Number 2: ACT inc. needs to secure more contracts with state boards. Securing contracts puts into effect more state-mandated participation in college admission tests. More participation in the ACT would mean more students get the opportunity to consider and hopefully get into college.
ACT inc. lost the contracts for Colorado, Illinois, Michigan and Rhode Island to the college board. The loss can be made up for by appealing to states such as Alaska where participation rates need to be greatly improved and college going behaviour can use an uptick. Other states which currently do not offer the ACT or SAT such as Georgia can also be considered.
