    "Since 2001, states have been adopting and implementing varying state-wide assessments, including the ACT and SAT. Signing a contract with ACT inc. to administer the ACT had and continues to have two benefits in that it (i) provides students with an opportunity to take a college admissions test and (ii) encourages more students to consider college upon high school graduation. However, recently the SAT has ben outpacing the ACT in participation. In this project, we aim to analyse ACT and SAT participation and scoring by state from 2017 and 2018 to better understand how we can improve ACT participation rates across states and whether increased participation in either test, does indeed show an uptick in high school graduates opting to go to college."

Since the 1940's, an increasing number of colleges have been using scores from sudents' performances on tests like the SAT and the ACT as a measure for college readiness and aptitude ([*source*](https://www.minotdailynews.com/news/local-news/2017/04/a-brief-history-of-the-sat-and-act/)). Supporters of these tests argue that these scores can be used as an objective measure to determine college admittance. Opponents of these tests claim that these tests are not accurate measures of students potential or ability and serve as an inequitable barrier to entry. Lately, more and more schools are opting to drop the SAT/ACT requirement for their Fall 2021 applications ([*read more about this here*](https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/14/us/coronavirus-colleges-sat-act-test-trnd/index.html))."

The ACT was marketed as a test to replace and standardize the graduation requirements for high school juniors with the intent to give every student access to a college admissions test and motivate more students to consider college upon graduation ([source](https://blog.prepscholar.com/which-states-require-the-act-full-list-and-advice)).
