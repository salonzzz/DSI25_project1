    "Since 2001, states have been adopting and implementing varying state-wide assessments, including the ACT and SAT. Signing a contract with ACT inc. to administer the ACT had and continues to have two benefits in that it (i) provides students with an opportunity to take a college admissions test and (ii) encourages more students to consider college upon high school graduation. However, recently the SAT has been gaining more traction with the potential to outpace the ACT in participation. In this project, we aim to analyse ACT and SAT participation and scoring by state from 2017 and 2018 to better understand how we can improve ACT participation rates across states and whether increased participation in either test, does indeed show an uptick in high school graduates opting to go to college."

    "The SAT and ACT are standardized tests that many colleges and universities in the United States require for their admissions process.

    "Standardized tests have long been a controversial topic for students, administrators, and legislators. Since the 1940's, an increasing number of colleges have been using scores from sudents' performances on tests like the SAT and the ACT as a measure for college readiness and aptitude ([*source*](https://www.minotdailynews.com/news/local-news/2017/04/a-brief-history-of-the-sat-and-act/)). Supporters of these tests argue that these scores can be used as an objective measure to determine college admittance. Opponents of these tests claim that these tests are not accurate measures of students potential or ability and serve as an inequitable barrier to entry. Lately, more and more schools are opting to drop the SAT/ACT requirement for their Fall 2021 applications ([*read more about this here*](https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/14/us/coronavirus-colleges-sat-act-test-trnd/index.html))."

    "ACT was introduced in late 1959 by ACT, Inc. and has since gained steady traction, with Colorado and Illinois being one of the first to implement it as a state-wide test in 2001 and numerous other states following suit ([source](https://www.act.org/content/act/en/about-act.html)). The ACT was marketed as a test to replace and standardize the graduation requirements for high school juniors with the intent to give every student access to a college admissions test and motivate more students to consider college upon graduation ([source](https://blog.prepscholar.com/which-states-require-the-act-full-list-and-advice)). Currently,13 states require high school juniors to sit the test while 8 others offer it as an option, at no extra cost to the student ([source](https://blog.prepscholar.com/which-states-require-the-act-full-list-and-advice)).\n",

Over time, the test has gained more popularity with tests becoming administered at no cost to students and better test-prep resources becoming readily available ([source](https://www.wsj.com/articles/sat-scores-fall-as-more-students-take-the-test-11569297660)). 20 states have made it a graduation requirement for high school juniors while 7 states offer it but do not require it ([source](https://blog.prepscholar.com/which-states-require-the-sat)). \n"

    "* Participation rate\n",
    "\n",
    "Alabama, Kentucky, Wisconsin, Utah and Tennessee maintained a 100% participation rate from 2017-2018. These states all require the ACT as a graduation requirement though Tennessee also offers the SAT as an alternative. \n",
    "\n",
    "North and South Dakota as well as Hawaii show consistency in ranking high in participation rates across 2017-2018 for the ACT. North Dakota and Hawaii require the ACT. However, South Dakota as well as Kansas do not. Nonetheless, it seems to be the traditionally [preferred]( https://www.studypoint.com/ed/sat-and-act-test/) college admissions test in the Midwest. Interestingly, Illinois, which traditionally preferred the ACT, signed with the college board to administer the [SAT in 2016](https://chicago.chalkbeat.org/2018/7/27/21105418/illinois-has-embraced-the-sat-and-the-act-is-mad-about-it). While it still has a 93% participation rate in 2017, it drops to 43% in 2018 showing that the state is moving away from the ACT and embracing the SAT. However, there has been debate of biasness shown by the state board in choosing the college board’s contract over ACT inc.’s and given that the contract lasts for 3 years, there is a possibility to explore how ACT inc. can once again bid to establish its stronghold on Illinois.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same 5 states- Maine, Rhode Island, New Hampshire, Delaware and Pennsylvania, showed consistency low participation rates in the ACT from 2017-2018. Apart from Rhode Island and Pennsylvania, all states require the SAT hence explaining the low ACT participation rates. The former two states show a consistency high levels of participation in the SAT across 2017-2018 as is characteristic of East Coast. \n",
    "\n",
    "* What does the year to year participation change tell\n",
    "\n",
    "The 16% increase in participation from 2017-2018 for Nebraska is a direct result of the state [requiring the ACT]( https://www.education.ne.gov/assessment/act/) to be administered from the beginning of spring 2017. Ohio offers both the ACT and SAT but a strong preference for the ACT can be observed given its 25% increase in participation from 2017-2018.\n",
    "\n",
    "Colorado shows a whopping 70% decrease in participation (previously 100% in 2017), Illinois  50% and Michigan 7% - all these scenarios can be attributed to the [college board winning contracts]( https://thecriticalreader.com/for-what-its-worth/) over the ACT inc. with the respective state boards in 2015-2016. The SAT gaining traction seems closely linked to the revision of the SAT format in 2016 which aimed to be more aligned with the Core Curriculum, making it more relevant to college-bound high schoolers. \n",
    "\n",
    "Alaska is interesting in that their contract to administer the SAT or ACT [expired in 2016]( https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/education/2016/06/30/students-no-longer-need-national-tests-to-graduate/) so neither test was required from the following year onwards. This explains the 32% decrease in participation in the ACT. The likely reason may be that students now have to pay out of pocket for the tests themselves which can be a deterrent. The state board could potentially be persuaded to sign with ACT inc. if they can be convinced that their investment in education does yield positive outcomes in the form of better student participation/ student motivation levels to do the test and higher number of students wanting to pursue college studies. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Observing the relationship between composite scores and relative participation rate\n",
    "\n",
    "States with close to 100%  participation in both 2017 and 2018, seem to have some of the lowest mean composite scores while states with less than 35% participation seem to yield the highest mean composite scores. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is a simple elaboration for the results – [here]( https://www.compassprep.com/great-to-good-the-diluted-value-of-high-test-scores/). To summarise, when more students are state-mandated to take a test, they take a test for the sake of it as opposed to those who opt to take the test. This means that though there might be 100% participation, they are not all performing to the best of their ability. States where participation was lower but mean composite scores were higher probably had a smaller group of students with a focused intent on getting into college a.k.a high achievers. Additionally, when more students take a test, the distribution of scores tends to become more diluted which means it may not be a good or true representation of the state’s performance when compared to say the median which might be a better indicator.

Florida only recently signed on to provide [free access](https://info.fldoe.org/docushare/dsweb/Get/Document-8938/dps-2020-92.pdf) to either the SAT or ACT in 2020. However, in the context of this project, they took the SAT preferentially. Interestingly for Massachusetts, there is no requirement to take either test but between 20-30% opt to take the ACT while 70-80% opt to take the SAT. With prestigious universities such as Harvard and MIT being regionally proximal, it can be posited that this greatly influences the opt-in behaviour observed in the participation rates. Additionally, these students might be vying for [scholarships](https://www.edmit.me/blog/2018/01/02/higher-test-scores-lower-tuition)that are offered based on how well one performs on the ACT or SAT. \n",
    "\n",

This means they too require the SAT and it explains the 26% increase in participation from 2017 to 2018. \n",
    "\n",
    "The increase in participation for West Virginia (14%) and New Jersey (12%) cannot seem to be attributed to any distinct event. West Virginia shows a stronger participation in the ACT (>60% in both 2017 and 2018) while New Jersey shows a stronger participation in the SAT (>70% in both 2017 and 2018).\n",

    "Honesty time: The data for florida is inputted wrongly. The participation change should be 0.14. The SAT participation rate in 2018 was 97% not 56%. Noted that I have not corrected this mistake in my dataset, I have only noticed it and am pointing it out. \n",

    "\n",
    "* What is the relationship between 100% participation in either ACT or SAT and college going rate\n",
    "\n",
    "We see a range of 44-80% college going rate. This is encouraging to see though states under 50% college going rate such as Idaho (44%) and Utah (47%), where the ACT is mandated, warrant further investigation. Perhaps students in this region may not be as motivated to go to college or there may be other socio-economic factors at play that pose as a barrier to entry to college. \n",
    "\n",
    "* What is the relationship between >50% participation in both ACT and SAT and college going rate\n",
    "\n",
    "It is good to see that states that have >50% participation on both tests show high college going rates between 61-69%. It warrants further investigation what factors might be influencing the college going behavior. The administration and participation in both tests show a positive attitude towards education and further education at that. Florida and Georgia do not mandate either test so it would be interesting to see why they display positive college going behaviour. Once again, this might be attributed to socio-economic factors. i.e. people in these states may be more affluent allowing for them to take the tests at their own cost and opt for a college education. \n",
    "\n",
    "* What is the relationship between <50% participation in both ACT and SAT with college college rates?\n",
    "\n",
    "States with <50% participation on both tests bring about inconclusive results. In both Alaska and Oregon, the state does not require high schoolers to take the SAT or ACT. However, Alaska shows poor college going rates (41%) and based on previous observations, it may be safe to posit that students are either not motivated to pursue further education or they lack the means to do and as a result, do not try to take either test. Oregon on the other hand shows a high college going rate (56%) suggesting that despite low participation on either test, the ones that opt to do the tests are high achievers aiming to go to college. It might be worth investigating why Oregon shows such a drastically different attitude towards education when compared to Alaska. "

    "## Visualize the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "There's not a magic bullet recommendation for the right number of plots to understand a given dataset, but visualizing your data is *always* a good idea. Not only does it allow you to quickly convey your findings (even if you have a non-technical audience), it will often reveal trends in your data that escaped you when you were looking only at numbers. It is important to not only create visualizations, but to **interpret your visualizations** as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Every plot should**:\n",
    "- Have a title\n",
    "- Have axis labels\n",
    "- Have appropriate tick labels\n",
    "- Text is legible in a plot\n",
    "- Plots demonstrate meaningful and valid relationships\n",
    "- Have an interpretation to aid understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of what your plots should look like following the above guidelines. Note that while the content of this example is unrelated, the principles of visualization hold:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://snag.gy/hCBR1U.jpg)\n",
    "*Interpretation: The above image shows that as we increase our spending on advertising, our sales numbers also tend to increase. There is a positive correlation between advertising spending and sales.*\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some prompts to get you started with visualizations. Feel free to add additional visualizations as you see fit:\n",
    "1. Use Seaborn's heatmap with pandas `.corr()` to visualize correlations between all numeric features.\n",
    "    - Heatmaps are generally not appropriate for presentations, and should often be excluded from reports as they can be visually overwhelming. **However**, they can be extremely useful in identify relationships of potential interest (as well as identifying potential collinearity before modeling).\n",
    "    - Please take time to format your output, adding a title. Look through some of the additional arguments and options. (Axis labels aren't really necessary, as long as the title is informative).\n",
    "2. Visualize distributions using histograms. If you have a lot, consider writing a custom function and use subplots.\n",
    "    - *OPTIONAL*: Summarize the underlying distributions of your features (in words & statistics)\n",
    "         - Be thorough in your verbal description of these distributions.\n",
    "         - Be sure to back up these summaries with statistics.\n",
    "         - We generally assume that data we sample from a population will be normally distributed. Do we observe this trend? Explain your answers for each distribution and how you think this will affect estimates made from these data.\n",
    "3. Plot and interpret boxplots. \n",
    "    - Boxplots demonstrate central tendency and spread in variables. In a certain sense, these are somewhat redundant with histograms, but you may be better able to identify clear outliers or differences in IQR, etc.\n",
    "    - Multiple values can be plotted to a single boxplot as long as they are of the same relative scale (meaning they have similar min/max values).\n",
    "    - Each boxplot should:\n",
    "        - Only include variables of a similar scale\n",
    "        - Have clear labels for each variable\n",
    "        - Have appropriate titles and labels\n",
    "4. Plot and interpret scatter plots to view relationships between features. Feel free to write a custom function, and subplot if you'd like. Functions save both time and space.\n",
    "    - Your plots should have:\n",
    "        - Two clearly labeled axes\n",
    "        - A proper title\n",
    "        - Colors and symbols that are clear and unmistakable\n",
    "5. Additional plots of your choosing.\n",
    "    - Are there any additional trends or relationships you haven't explored? Was there something interesting you saw that you'd like to dive further into? It's likely that there are a few more plots you might want to generate to support your narrative and recommendations that you are building toward. **As always, make sure you're interpreting your plots as you go**."

    "ACT inc. needs to focus on two objectives:\n",
    "1. Persuade state boards, educators and students to endorse the efficacy of the ACT in preparing students for getting into college. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Persuade more state boards to draw contracts with the organisation. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Number 1:**\n",
    "In 2016, the College Board revitalised the SAT and since then has not only secured more contracts with state-boards but has seen an uptick in participation rates. Additionally, participation in the SAT is seen to be positively associated with college going behaviour. This suggests that people are starting to prefer the SAT as it perhaps, better prepares students for college. Additionally, in states where college admission tests are not mandated, the SAT is still a cheaper alternative, making is more accessible to those from a financially challenged background. It also has the effect of incentivising more students to choose the SAT over the ACT.\n",
    "\n",
    "It might be worth considering revising the content of the ACT to align it better with standards expected of students at college. Giving educators and students more confidence in the content and its ability to prepare them for college might improve participation rates and college going rates. An additional consideration may be to reduce the cost of the ACT to make it more accessible and appealing to students from varying socio-economic backgrounds. \n",
    "\n",
    "The ACT needs to reiterate its purpose to students and educators- It exists to provide students with opportunity and access to better tertiary outcomes. This can be reinforced by reminding the public of the usefulness of the Science component in the ACT which gives students a competitive edge over their SAT counterparts. The ACT nurtures a more holistic and well-rounded student. Additionally, it needs to be communicated that [evidence](https://www.edmit.me/blog/2018/01/02/higher-test-scores-lower-tuition) suggests that ACT scores are considered and awarded scholarships to universities more easily than SAT scores. \n",
    "\n",
    "More test prep resources can be made available and accessible to students to boost their confidence in doing well in the test. For example, the college board collaborated with Khan Academy to release [free test prep material](https://theolivebook.com/sat-vs-act-which-is-more-popular/) to students. A similar tactic should be considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the states requiring its students to take the ACT, Idaho and Utah see <50% of their students going to college. It suggests that they could use more test prep resources and encouragement to engage in college going behaviour. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Number 2:**\n",
    "ACT inc. needs to secure more contracts with state boards. Securing contracts puts into effect more state-mandated participation in college admission tests. More participation in the ACT would mean more students get the opportunity to consider and hopefully get into college. \n",
    "\n",
    "ACT inc. lost the contracts for Colorado, Illinois, Michigan and Rhode Island to the college board. The loss can be made up for by appealing to states such as Alaska where participation rates need to be greatly improved and college going behaviour can use an uptick. Other states which currently do not offer the ACT or SAT such as Georgia can also be considered. "
